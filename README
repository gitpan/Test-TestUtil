1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Indentification

    This release is a collection of Perl modules that extend the
    capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. The system does
    not have any hardware. The Perl programming language contains two
    features that are utilized by this release:

    1   Program Modules to extend the languages

    2   Plain Old Documentation (POD) that may be embedded in the language

    These features are established by the referenced documents.

    This release adds low level utilites used initially in support of
    Test::STDmaker and ExtUtils::SVDmaker but may have uses in other
    modules.

    The dependency of the program modules in the Test::STDmaker
    ExtUtils::SVDmaker US DOD STD2167A bundle is as follows:

     Test::TestUtil
         Test::Tester
            DataPort::FormDB
                Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker

    Test system should be as short and not depend on any other modules. In
    other words, it should use just the basic core pure Perl and as little
    of the extension modules as possible. As such these utilities are a
    collection of very short methods, using core pure Perl and very few
    program modules of seemingly functionally unrelated methods.

    Some of the capabilities they provide are as follows:

    *   Methods to change file specifications from one operating system to
        another.

    *   Methods that address the issue of different new line sequences for
        different operating systems

    *   Formatting raw array tables for inclusion in PODS

    *   Picking up data from program modules

    *   Loading program modules using an *eval* and testing that the program
        module vocabulary is present.

  3.3 Changes

    Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
    <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> test run

    t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....Bareword "fspec_dirs" not allowed while
    "strict subs" in use at

      /net/sunu991/disc1/.cpanplus/5.8.0/build/Test-TestUtil-0.01/blib/lib/Test/TestUtil.pm line 56.

    Changed line 56 from

     my @dirs = (fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

    to

     my @dirs = ($fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

    This error is troublesome since the test passed on my system using
    Active Perl under Microsoft NT. It should never have passed. This error
    is in a core method, *fspec2fspec*, that changes file specifications
    from one operating system to another operating system. This method has
    been in service unchanged for some time.

    DOCUMENT_OVERVIEW: This document releases Test::TestUtil version 0.02
    providing a description of the inventory, installation instructions and
    other information necessary to utilize and track this release.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. Installation sites running Microsoft
    Operating systems require the installation of Unix utilities. An
    excellent, highly recommended Unix utilities for Microsoft operating
    systems is unxutils by Karl M. Syring. A copy is available at the
    following web sites:

     http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
     http://packages.SoftwareDiamnds.com

    There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of
    configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
    installation particular to any installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.

    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.

  3.6 Installation instructions.

    To installed the release file, use the CPAN module in the Perl release
    or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web site:

     http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

    Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

    The distribution file is at the following respositories:

       http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/Test-TestUtil-0.02
       http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/Test-TestUtil-0.02

  3.6.1 Installation support.

    If there are installation problems or questions with the installation
    contact

     603 882-0846 E<lt>support@SoftwareDiamonds.comE<gt>

  3.6.2 Installation Tests.

    Most Perl installation software will run the following test script(s) as
    part of the installation:

     t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    This is the foundation program module for testing and must be rock solid
    to ensure the quality of the Units that it will be testing. Testing of
    this module should be proactive and not dumped upon the end-user.

    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    *   State the functional requirements for each method including not only
        the GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths

    *   All the tests are GO path tests. Should add NOGO tests.

    *   Add the requirements addressed as *# R: * comment to the tests

    *   Write a program to build a matrix to trace test step to the
        requirements and vice versa by parsing the *# R: * comments.
        Automatically insert the matrix in the Test::TestUtil POD.
