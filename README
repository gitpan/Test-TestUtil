1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Indentification

    This release is a collection of Perl modules that extend the
    capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. The system does
    not have any hardware. The Perl programming language contains two
    features that are utilized by this release:

    1   Program Modules to extend the languages

    2   Plain Old Documentation (POD) that may be embedded in the language

    These features are established by the referenced documents.

    This release adds low level utilites used initially in support of
    Test::STDmaker and ExtUtils::SVDmaker but may have uses in other
    modules.

    The dependency of the program modules in the Test::STDmaker
    ExtUtils::SVDmaker US DOD STD2167A bundle is as follows:

     Test::TestUtil
         Test::Tester
            DataPort::FormDB
                Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker

    Test software should be short and not depend on any other modules. In
    other words, it should use just the basic core pure Perl and as little
    of the extension modules as possible. As such these utilities are a
    collection of very short methods, using core pure Perl and very few
    program modules (SelfLoader and use File::Spec) of seemingly
    functionally unrelated methods.

    Some of the capabilities they provide are as follows:

    *   Methods to change file specifications from one operating system to
        another.

    *   Methods that address the issue of different new line sequences for
        different operating systems

    *   Formatting raw array tables for inclusion in PODS

    *   Picking up data from program modules

    *   Loading program modules using an *eval* and testing that the program
        module vocabulary is present.

  1.3 Document overview.

  3.3 Changes

    Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
    <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> test run

    PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/perl/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM"
    "-e" "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')"
    t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....# Test 18 got:
    '$VAR1 = ''; ' (t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t at line 540 fail #17) #
    Expected: '$VAR1 = '\\=head1 Title Page

    The *pm2datah* method is not returning any data for Test 18. This will
    also cause the test of *pm2data*, test 19 to fail. The *pm2datah* is
    searching for the string "\n__DATA__\n".

    The "\n" character on Perl is a logical end of line character sequence.
    The "\n" end of line is different on Mr. Smokehouse's Unix operating
    system than on my Windows NT operating system. The test file was created
    under MSWin32 and uses a MSWin32 "\n". Under UNIX, *pm2datah* method
    will look for the Unix "\n" and there will not be any.

    Changed "\n__DATA__\n" to /[\012\015]__DATA__/.

    During the clean-up for CPAN, broke the *format_hash_table* method for
    tables in hash of hash format. Fixed the break, added test 29 to the
    *t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t* test script for this feature, and added a
    discusssion of this feature in POD discription for *format_hash_table*

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. Installation sites running Microsoft
    Operating systems require the installation of Unix utilities. An
    excellent, highly recommended Unix utilities for Microsoft operating
    systems is unxutils by Karl M. Syring. A copy is available at the
    following web sites:

     http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
     http://packages.SoftwareDiamnds.com

    There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of
    configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
    installation particular to any installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.

    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.

  3.6 Installation instructions.

    To installed the release file, use the CPAN module in the Perl release
    or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web site:

     http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

    Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

    The distribution file is at the following respositories:

       http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/Test-TestUtil-0.03
       http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/Test-TestUtil-0.03

  3.6.1 Installation support.

    If there are installation problems or questions with the installation
    contact

     603 882-0846 E<lt>support@SoftwareDiamonds.comE<gt>

  3.6.2 Installation Tests.

    Most Perl installation software will run the following test script(s) as
    part of the installation:

     t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    The *pm2datah* method determines the data section by searching for the
    token /[\012\015]__DATA__/. Currently the *pm2datah* test only tests for
    "\n__DATA__" for the current operating system. The test should be for
    all operating systems, not just the current one.

    The Test::TestUtil program module is the foundation program module for
    testing and must be rock solid to ensure the quality of the Units that
    it will be testing. Testing of this module should be proactive and not
    dumped upon the end-user.

    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    *   State the functional requirements for each method including not only
        the GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths

    *   All the tests are GO path tests. Should add NOGO tests.

    *   Add the requirements addressed as *# R: * comment to the tests

    *   Write a program to build a matrix to trace test step to the
        requirements and vice versa by parsing the *# R: * comments.
        Automatically insert the matrix in the Test::TestUtil POD.
