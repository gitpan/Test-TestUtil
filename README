1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Indentification

    This release is a collection of Perl modules that extend the
    capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. The system does
    not have any hardware. The Perl programming language contains two
    features that are utilized by this release:

    1   Program Modules to extend the languages

    2   Plain Old Documentation (POD) that may be embedded in the language

    These features are established by the referenced documents.

    This release adds low level utilites used initially in support of
    Test::STDmaker and ExtUtils::SVDmaker but may have uses in other
    modules.

    The dependency of the program modules in the Test::STDmaker
    ExtUtils::SVDmaker US DOD STD2167A bundle is as follows:

     Test::TestUtil
         Test::Tech
            DataPort::DataFile DataPort::FileType::FormDB
                Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker

    Test software should be short and not depend on any other modules. In
    other words, it should use just the basic core pure Perl and as little
    of the extension modules as possible. As such these utilities are a
    collection of very short methods, using core pure Perl and very few
    program modules (SelfLoader and use File::Spec) of seemingly
    functionally unrelated methods.

    Some of the capabilities they provide are as follows:

    *   Methods to change file specifications from one operating system to
        another.

    *   Methods that address the issue of different new line sequences for
        different operating systems

    *   Formatting raw array tables for inclusion in PODS

    *   Picking up data from program modules

    *   Loading program modules using an *eval* and testing that the program
        module vocabulary is present.

  1.3 Document overview.

    This document releases Test::TestUtil version 0.04 providing a
    description of the inventory, installation instructions and other
    information necessary to utilize and track this release.

  3.3 Changes

    The changes from the previous version are as follows:

    our old friend visits again - DOS and UNIX text file incompatibility
        This impacts other modules. We have to examine all modules for this
        portability defect and correct any found defects.

        Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
        <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> and Kingpin
        <mthurn@carbon> test runs.

        On Mr. Smokehouse's run email the got: VAR1 clearly showed extra
        white space line that is not present in the expected: VAR1. In Mr.
        Kingpin's run the got: VAR1 and expected: VAR1 look visually the
        same. However, the Unix found a difference(s) and failed the test.

        For Mr. Smokehouse's run:

        PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "-e"
        "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')"
        t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....NOK 18# Test
        18 got: '$VAR1 = '\\=head1 Title Page

        What we have before, was a totally "failure to communicate." aka
        Cool Hand Luke. VAR1 was empty. Now VAR1 has something. It is not
        completely dead. One probable cause is the Unix operating system
        must be producing two Unix \012 new lines for a Microsoft single
        newline \015\012. Without being able to examine the test with a
        debugger, the only way to verify this is to provide the fix and see
        if the problem goes away when this great group of testers try for
        the fourth time.

        Revised *fin* method to take a handle, change *pm2datah* method
        handle, *$fh*, to binary by adding a *binmode $fh* statement, and
        pass the actual thru the *fin* method for test 18.

        Use *fin($fh)* to read in the data for *pm2data*, test 19 Unit Under
        Test (UUT), instead of using the raw file handle.

        The *fin* method takes any \015\012 combination and changes it into
        the logical Perl new line, *"\n"*, for the current operating system.

    Namespace conflict
        Someone is complain that they have uploaded a Test-Tester before my
        upload Changed Test-Tester to Test-Tech and submitted a registration
        for Test-Tech. This impacts documentation for this module.

    Setup Unix Portability Test Machine
        This development of portable code with the tester on one side of the
        big pond called the Atlantic ocean and the developer on the other
        side could use some improvement. Need to take one of Crystal's PCs
        she is not using and put up Free BSD for portability testing. This
        way the CPAN version numbers will not be spining so fast.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. Installation sites running Microsoft
    Operating systems require the installation of Unix utilities. An
    excellent, highly recommended Unix utilities for Microsoft operating
    systems is unxutils by Karl M. Syring. A copy is available at the
    following web sites:

     http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
     http://packages.SoftwareDiamnds.com

    There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of
    configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
    installation particular to any installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.

    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.

  3.6 Installation instructions.

    To installed the release file, use the CPAN module in the Perl release
    or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web site:

    DOCUMENT_OVERVIEW: This document releases ${NAME} version ${VERSION}
    providing a description of the inventory, installation instructions and
    other information necessary to utilize and track this release. ^

    CAPABILITIES: This release adds low level utilites used initially in
    support of Test::STDmaker and ExtUtils::SVDmaker but may have uses in
    other modules.

    The dependency of the program modules in the Test::STDmaker
    ExtUtils::SVDmaker US DOD STD2167A bundle is as follows:

     Test::TestUtil
         Test::Tech
            DataPort::DataFile DataPort::FileType::FormDB
                Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker

    Test software should be short and not depend on any other modules. In
    other words, it should use just the basic core pure Perl and as little
    of the extension modules as possible. As such these utilities are a
    collection of very short methods, using core pure Perl and very few
    program modules (SelfLoader and use File::Spec) of seemingly
    functionally unrelated methods.

    Some of the capabilities they provide are as follows:

    \=over 4

    \=item *

    Methods to change file specifications from one operating system to
    another.

    \=item *

    Methods that address the issue of different new line sequences for
    different operating systems

    \=item *

    Formatting raw array tables for inclusion in PODS

    \=item *

    Picking up data from program modules

    \=item *

    Loading program modules using an *eval* and testing that the program
    module vocabulary is present.

    \=back ^

    PROBLEMS: The *pm2datah* and *pm2data* methods determines the data
    section by searching for the expression /^[\012\015]__DATA__$/. If
    somehow this sequence appears in the code, it will cause a failure of
    these methods. Thus, when using this function, statments such as the
    below (if it is even a valid statement) cannot be used:

     $var = '
     __DATA__
     ';

    The Test::TestUtil program module is the foundation program module for
    testing and must be rock solid to ensure the quality of the Units that
    it will be testing. Testing of this module should be proactive and not
    dumped upon the end-user.

    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    \=over 4

    \=item *

    State the functional requirements for each method including not only the
    GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths

    \=item *

    All the tests are GO path tests. Should add NOGO tests.

    \=item *

    Add the requirements addressed as *# R: * comment to the tests

    \=item *

    Write a program to build a matrix to trace test step to the requirements
    and vice versa by parsing the *# R: * comments. Automatically insert the
    matrix in the Test::TestUtil POD.
